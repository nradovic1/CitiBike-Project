## Background
Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City boroughs that was launched in May 27, 2013. Currently, it is the largest bike sharing program in the United States, with 48,315 daily rides and over 17,000 vehicles. The name was given after the lead sponsor of the program, Citi Group, but was bought by Lyft in 2018.

## Purpose
The purpsoe of this project is to create a platform that gives details on every Citi Bike in Manhatten with real-time data from Cti Bike API. Furthermore, we will extract 2020 data from the same API and using Tableau, look at some trends and analyze the ridership program and see where there are opportunities for growth.
